-- disable highlighting for the `tex` filetype, you need to include `latex` in this list as this is
-- the name of the parser)
-- list of language that will be disabled

-- Setting this to true will run `:h syntax` and tree-sitter at the same time.
-- Set this to `true` if you depend on 'syntax' being enabled (like for indentation).
-- Using this option may slow down your editor, and you may see some duplicate highlights.
-- Instead of true it can also be a list of languages
